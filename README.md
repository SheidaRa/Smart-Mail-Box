# Smart-Mail-Box
In this project, I created an IoT system that uses a Raspberry Pi and a motion sensor to send notifications when a mailbox has received mail. This can be useful for individuals who are unable to check their mailbox regularly or who want to be notified as soon as possible when they receive mail.

The code imports the RPi.GPIO, time, and smtplib libraries. RPi.GPIO is used for controlling the General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins on a Raspberry Pi, time is used for creating delays, and smtplib is used for sending emails. The code sets the pin numbering mode to physical pin numbering using the GPIO.setmode() method and passing in GPIO.BOARD as the argument. The code sets pin 10 as an input pin using the GPIO.setup() method, passing in 10 as the pin number and GPIO.IN as the mode. The pull_up_down argument is set to GPIO.PUD_DOWN, which means the initial value of the pin is pulled low (off).
The  send_email()  is used to send an email when the mail is detected. The function takes no arguments. It starts by defining the sender's email address, the recipient's email address, and the email account's password. These values are set as strings and can be changed to any valid email address and password. The function then establishes a connection to the Gmail SMTP server using the smtplib.SMTP() method, passing in 'smtp.gmail.com' as the server address and 587 as the port number. It then sends the EHLO command to the server using the ehlo() method to initiate the communication with the server and starts a secure connection using the starttls() method. It then sends the EHLO command again using the ehlo() method to confirm the secure connection. The function then logs in to the email account using the login() method, passing in the sender's email address and password as the arguments. It then creates a message to be sent in the form of a string containing the subject and body of the email.

The email notification message in the code is written in a fun and creative way because it adds a personal touch to the email and makes it more engaging for the recipient. The message starts with a catchy subject line "Snail Mail Notification" which immediately grabs the recipient's attention, it continues to have a creative message that describes the excitement of receiving mail. It creates a feeling of anticipation and excitement for the recipient, making them more likely to check their mailbox. Using a fun and creative message also helps to differentiate the email notification from other types of emails that the recipient may receive, such as spam or automated emails. It makes the email more memorable and stands out in the recipient's inbox. Additionally, by using a fun and creative message, the email notification is more likely to be shared and spread to others, increasing the reach of the notification.
The function then sends the email using the sendmail() method, passing in the sender's email address, the recipient's email address, and the message as the arguments. It then prints a message saying "Hey, email has been sent!" using the print() function to confirm the email has been sent. Finally, the function quits the SMTP server using the quit() method to close the connection. 

Then the code enters a while loop that runs indefinitely. Inside the loop, it checks the status of pin 10 using the GPIO.input() method and passes in 10 as the pin number. GPIO.HIGH represents a high voltage level on the pin, which is typically 3.3 volts on a Raspberry Pi. This state is often used to indicate that a pin is in an "on" or "active" state, such as when a button is pressed or a sensor is triggered.GPIO.LOW represents a low voltage level on the pin, which is typically 0 volts on a Raspberry Pi. This state is often used to indicate that a pin is in an "off" or "inactive" state, such as when a button is not pressed or a sensor is not triggered. If the value of the pin is high (GPIO.HIGH), the code calls the send_email() function and then sleeps for 600 seconds (10 minutes) using the time.sleep() method. If the value of the pin is low (GPIO.LOW), the code sleeps for 0.5 seconds using the time.sleep() method.

Then The code sleeps for 600 seconds (10 minutes) after the send_email() function is called because it is waiting for a certain amount of time before checking the status of the input pin again. The reason for this is to prevent multiple emails from being sent if the motion sensor is triggered multiple times within a short period of time. By waiting for 10 minutes after an email is sent, the script gives the user enough time to retrieve their mail and prevent multiple unnecessary emails. Additionally, a delay in the code also helps reduce the chances of the server being overloaded with too many requests in a short time. This would prevent the server from crashing and keep the system running smoothly.
